## What It Is & How It Works

I wanted to design an app that generated customizable cheese plates, and came up with this idea in my quest to find a good resource that would give me new cheeses to try for a dinner party or just in general.

This app currently works by generating new, empty cheeseplate objects and returning a list of various cheeses that exist in my SQL database. Users can currently create a new cheeseplate, change the name of a given cheeseplate, and delete a given cheeseplate.

I would like to enhance this app moving forward by allowing users to add cheeses to a given cheeseplate, and store representative cheese images in my database so that users have a better idea of what cheeses to choose.

## Development Process

1. Research app requirements and technologies.
2. Write out user stories for app.
3. Create wireframes for app using Sketch.
4. Craft a list of necessary parts.
5. Devise a version control workflow:
  -   Branch large-scope features such as 'front-end' or 'back-end' off of 'master', and then branch smaller feature branches off of those.
  -   Begin coding.
  -   Revisit list of necessary parts needed.
6. Revise version control workflow:
  -   Create a 'development' branch and for each feature make a single branch off of it, then merge that branch back into 'development'.
  -   Finally, merge back into 'master'. Also, create a 'to-do' list that is added to when coding and coming across issues or thinking of ideas, so that the focus is only on one problem at a time.
7. Revise code, spending time focusing on the requirements as opposed to interesting problems that are unimportant.
8. Once code is in a 'near-production' state, spend time working on testing as many possible use-cases as possible.
9. Once satisfied with completion of tests, remove all debugger, console.log, and other WIP code.
10. Deploy finalized project to GitHub Pages and test functionality again.
11. Write README file based off of notes.
12. Push final README to 'master' branch.
